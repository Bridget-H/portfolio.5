<h1>Get to know Bridget!</h1>
<p>Hello, Ive been a science teacher in Pittsburgh for the past two years. So if you have any questions about punnet squares or the Ph scale, I'm your girl. I have a dog and a parrot, who after 3 years has finally said her first words! My hobbies include hiking, ceramics, video games and cross stiching christmas stockings.</p>

  <h2>How I got into coding</h2>
  <p>At my school I was supspicios that the coding instructor wasn't actually teaching the children how to code. So I taught myself basic python out of a "Python for Dummies" book. I then went and asked my student some basic coding questions, and indeed found out that they were not being taught how to code, however I discover my own love of coding and decided to pursue that through this bootcamp!</p>
